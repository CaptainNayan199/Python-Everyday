#Loops are used for printing some sequence of codes for some n number of times.
# They are used to execute some lines of codes for multiple times
#For loop can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python

#Numbers and strings/characters cn be printed in different way using for loops in python

#Let's print numbers using For loop
#We have to use range to print numbers in python

# num = 10
# for i in range (num): # i is used as certain variable that is storing the values from 0 to provided number.
    # print(i) # the number from 0 to num-1 is printed
# but what if we want to print starting from 1 ?
#just change inside print

    # print(i+1) #starts printing from 1

# Likewise multiplication table can be also printed using for and range 

# number = int(input("Which number table do you want ? "))

# for i in range (0, 10):
#     print(number, " X " , (i+1), " = ", number*(i+1), "\n"  )
    

# Similaryl we can print charaters of a particular string using for loop as well

# name = "Nayan"
# for i in name:
#     print(i)

list = ["Pilot", "Driver", "Airplane", "Flight"]
