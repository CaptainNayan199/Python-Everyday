# while loop iss another type of loop that is used to execute certain code for multiple times
i = int(input("A number please : "))
while (i<10):
    i = int(input("A number please : "))
    print(i)
    
#until and unless the condition is true, while loops gets executed continuously

#decrement while loop
c = 5
while (c>0):
    print(c)
    c=c-1

# Else with while loop
num = int(input("ENter a number : "))
while(num%2==0):
    print(num, "is a even number.")
    break # dont worry abt this break, we will see break statement in tomorrow class.

    print(num, "is a odd number")
    
    
# So yeah this much for today, i know today session has been a bit shorter than previous one, but i am not feeling well, i think i need to take rest.
# So we'll meet tomorrow and we will see about break and continue statement in python
