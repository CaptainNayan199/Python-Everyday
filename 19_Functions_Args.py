# Functions in python can be either with arguments or without arguments (parameters too; btw parameters and arguments are different things)
# Functional arguments are placed inside a small brakcets or ps: in python it can be given in form of sets, dictionaries too. (dont worry abt this things, we will see them in brief in upcoming sessions)
#  Lets see the different types of arguments in python programming

# 1. Default Argument 
def sum (a=3, b=4):
    print("Sum is ", a+b)
sum() # see it seems preety simple, which is btw, a sum function is made with 2 parameters a and b, and then sum is printed by calling the functions
