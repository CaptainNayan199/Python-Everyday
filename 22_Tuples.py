# Tuples is also one of the most important sequential data types in python
# It is equally important as lists, and dictionaries(we'll talk abt it in future session).
# They are order collection of data with each elements seperated by commas, and enclosed within parenthesis.
# PS : Lists are enclosed inside a square brakcets, and TUples are enclosed inside a small brakets.

# PS : Tuples are immutable data types in python.
# That means once they are created, they cannot be changed or modified further unline lists which are mutable.
# Once a Tuple is created, it cannot be modified or changed further.

# eg : 
tuples1 = ("nayan", 1, 34, "pathak")
print(tuples1)
print(type(tuples1))

tup = (1)
print(tup)
print(type(tup)) # it will say it is int, because it is just a single value, if we want to create a tuple of single value than it is necessary to add a commaa after that value
