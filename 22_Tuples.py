# Tuples is also one of the most important sequential data types in python
# It is equally important as lists, and dictionaries(we'll talk abt it in future session).
# They are order collection of data with each elements seperated by commas, and enclosed within parenthesis.
# PS : Lists are enclosed inside a square brakcets, and TUples are enclosed inside a small brakets.

# PS : Tuples are immutable data types in python.
# That means once they are created, they cannot be changed or modified further unline lists which are mutable.
# Once a Tuple is created, it cannot be modified or changed further.
