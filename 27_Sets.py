# SO what are sets in python ?
# Sets are just the collection of unordered objects/well defined objects.

#  They are enclosed inside a curly braces, and are seperated by commas
# They are immutable, that means we cannot change the content of the set once we have created it.

set1 = {2,5,8,9}
print(set1)
