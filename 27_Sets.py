# SO what are sets in python ?
# Sets are just the collection of unordered objects/well defined objects.
# They dont take repeated values, and does not care about repeatation.

#  They are enclosed inside a curly braces, and are seperated by commas
# They are immutable, that means we cannot change the content of the set once we have created it.

set1 = {2,5,8,9}
print(set1)

set2 = {"Nayan", "23", "value", "this is set", False}
print(set2)
# set ignores the order.

# PS : We cannot access the values of the set by the use of indexing methods.
