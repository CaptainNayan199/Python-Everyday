# In previous session we talked about sets, and today we are going to see about some important sets methods.

set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {5,6,7,8}
print(set1+set2) # this is not the way to perform set operations
# well lets see some of the operations that can be performed in the set like union, intersection, etc.
print(set1.union(set2)) #this gives the union of two sets.

print(set1.intersection(set2)) #this gives intersection
