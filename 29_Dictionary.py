# Dictionary in python are as similar as real world dictionary (oxford), it contains multiple keys with their respective values.
# They are ordered collection of data.
# It is the combination of key value pairs.
# It is enclosed inside a curly braces as like set
# We can create a mapped data/elements in the dictionary.
# they store multiple items in a single variable.
# previously dict was unordered, but now they made this ordered.

dic1 = {
    "Name": "Nayan",
    "Age" : 20,
    "College": "TU",
    "isMarried": False
}
# so this is my simple dictionary with some key and its respective values.
# now i can access those by referencing theirs keys

print(dic1)
