# so today in this session we will see about shorthand if else in python programming langauge

a = 20
b = 30
print("Larger") if a>b else print("Smaller") if a<b else print("Equal") # it will give smaller as output


# this short hand statement will be useful when the condition is simple and code blocks are short to be executed
