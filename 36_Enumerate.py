# Enumerate is a built-in function in python that allows you to keep track of the number of iterations (loops) in a loop.
# it is used to keep record of number of iterations in loop

temp = [30,33,34,36,38,40,46]
index = 0
for i in temp:
    print(i)
    if(index == 5):
        print("The temperature is 40")
        break
    index+=1
#so here i have a list of temperature, and when the index value is 5 i want it to print the temperature is 40, its kind of hectic, isn't is?

# SO yeah this much for today, we will meet tomorrow, we will talk about enumeration in python.
# Thank you! Happy coding.
