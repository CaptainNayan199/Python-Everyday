# if__name__ == "__main__" is a very important pattern in python programming 
# A Python programme uses the condition if __name__ == '__main__' to only run the code inside the if statement when the program is run directly by the Python interpreter. The code inside the if statement is not executed when the file's code is imported as a module.

#  `if__name__` is a variable in python(inbuilt)

# Python has a large number of special variables that begin and end with double underscores. They are referred to as dunder to keep it brief (from Double Underscores). In this case, "__name__" is pronounced "dunder name."
