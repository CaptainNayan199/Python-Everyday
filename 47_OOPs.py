# There are two types of programming language(in general); one is procedure oriented and the other is object oriented

# POP - it follows top to bottom approach, runs sequentially, use functions mainly.
# OOP - it follows bottom up approach, use of real world entites called as objects, class.


# class - blueprint of real world
# Objects - instance of class, has its own methods

# Eg - Animal is a class, and i can make many objects of that Animal class, which can have many properties, methods, behavior, state, identity

# There are 4 pillars in OOP : 

# Encapsulation
# Polymorphism
# Inheritance
# Abstraction

# We will talk about all this imp things in details later on

# So yeah this was a simple basic of OOP, Dont depend only on this much, there are a lot of things that you need to study yourself regarding oop concept, just the theory part, read more research more, and make yourself theoretically perfect
