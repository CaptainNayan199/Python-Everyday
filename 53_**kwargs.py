# So lets talk about **kwargs in today session.

# **kwargs - same as *args, but will pack all the arguments into a dictionary, and is basically for keyword arguments, very useful when we need to accept multiple and different dta types key word arguments


# kwargs - keyword arguments

# One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.


# Eg 1 : 

def price(**kwargs): # all the arguments will be packed as dictionary with keys and respective values

    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print("Price of %s is %s" % (key, value)) 

price(Apple=200, Mango=400, Grapes=500, Kiwi=1000) # key word arguments

# again, kwargs is just the conventional name, we can name it as per our need, but ** is a must.

# So yeah this much for today, tomorrow we will be talking about inhertaince in python prgramming
# Thank you! Happy coding!
