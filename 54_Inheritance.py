# Inheritance is a very important topics in OOP.
# So what inheritance actually is ? ---> so inheritance is a key feature in OOP where a class can inherit methods, and properties of another class
# The same is in python as well, theres a parent class and we want to access its properties in another child class, to do so we need inheritance concepts.
# Code can be re used again and a relation ca be established within a class.

# A child class can access or inherit all the public and protected properties of the parent class
