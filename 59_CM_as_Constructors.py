# In previous session we talked about class methods - they are those types of methods that belongs/bounds to the class itself rather than to the instances of the class.
# One of the most prominent use of class method in python is as aditional constructors. 
# We can set the values of the constructors using the class methods
# Think of a class methods as a way to create class objects in a different way.

# Using class methods as additional constructors can make your code more flexible and user-friendly, allowing you to create objects from a class in various ways depending on your specific needs.
